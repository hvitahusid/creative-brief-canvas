This is the single benefit that the product or service is promising the consumer: what it's proposing. As outlined in the previous chapter, it's crucial that the proposition is a singular promise or benefit, and not multiple.

The proposition is the most important part of the brief. Creatively speaking it’s the starting point for creating concepts.

Loforðið getur verið **SMP**, **USP** eða **ESP**

* **SMP** = single minded proposition. The key is to say one thing that is different about your product (of genuine interest to the consumer), or be the first to say something that the competition could say, but has yet to realize it through its advertising.
* **USP** = unique selling proposition. USP is the ultimate proposition because it is one that no other competitior can claim. Of course it has to be something that you could also sell from. Most products are equal, generic, parity products and therefore do not have an obvious USP.
* **ESP** = Emotional selling proposition

Proposition support points:<br>
These are the concrete reasons or facts that allow the proposition to exist. It supports it’s claim, giving the consumer permission to accept the product benefit. Each list contains berween one and five points, placed in order of importance or relevance to the chosen proposition. Support points vary according to the product and are usually a result of research and market positioing. From a creative point of view, the support points can often contain an inspiring fact or niugget of information that can launch an executiojn, or even an entire campaign thought.
